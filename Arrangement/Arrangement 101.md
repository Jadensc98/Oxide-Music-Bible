![[Music-Arrangement-Tips-710x473-427fd165.jpg]]

Arrangement is **the flow of a song from start to finish**. It has sections: like an intro, verse, buildup, chorus, breakdown, drop, and outro. 

If you’ve been producing music for longer than a day, you know how many decisions need to be made within the process. The best producers out there have built a system of working through these decisions and sticking with them. You don’t want to be thinking about structural arrangement after you’ve recorded the final vocal. And seriously, you don’t need to get bogged down with the details of mix arrangement when you’re developing a chord progression.

## Instruments
Determining which instruments carry the melody, chords, and harmony can come first in the process or at the very end. It’s important to know that both options are available, but it’s still a decision you need to make, whether that’s in the conception phase or when the rest of the track is built out.

Some producers like to start with a simple piano patch to build out their chords. Others prefer to take care of sound design first. Got a sweet sounding polysynth? Go ahead and lay some chords down with it. Between the two, I’m in favor of whatever works best for you and your workflow.

That being said, you’ll need to make voicing decisions at some point, and sound design early in the process has its benefits. If you decide to put those chords on a 80’s sounding polysynth instead of a rhodes piano, it will change the direction and vibe of your track.

## Structure
You should be thinking about arranging for flow once you have a basic idea built out. Maybe that’s an 8-bar loop, a chord progression and melody, or a high energy phrase that would make a great drop.

Right now, you don’t have a song. You have an idea, which is seriously exciting. But in order for it to be a song, it needs a different section. You’ve got B, now you need A. There’s a mindset shift we’ll cover below that will let you take any section of music and create its counterpart, but more on that in a moment.

Those that know me will know what’s coming, but it’s so important that it bears mentioning again. And again.

In order to create great music, you need to reference.

Using tried and true forms is surprisingly liberating. It’s actually a lot easier to create fresh and inventive music within constraints than it is to try to reinvent the wheel every time you’re writing. Referencing is as simple as dragging a song you admire in to your DAW, warping it to match your song’s tempo, and adding flags or markers at the beginning of every new section.

You don’t need to adhere perfectly to every bar, but let it be a loose guideline for your song’s structure. Once you’ve got a structure to work towards, we can easily take this idea and reverse engineer a way to built up to it.

## Tips for arrangement
1. **Reference Tracks** (See [[Reference Tracks]])
2. **Song dynamics** (See [[Dynamics]]). A restrained, reigned in verse will feel more impactful moving to a big chorus than if everything was big and loud from the first bar.
3. **Take a risk and try something new** (See [[Your Style]]). You owe it to yourself. Maybe it’s a bold sound design move for a transition, a new way of using a synth or effect...this isn’t just a way to keep your arrangements fresh and interesting, but a way to keep yourself engaged and challenged in the writing process.
4. **Use repetition to your advantage**. Seriously. With enough repetition, anything can become a main melody or motif in a song. It’s one of the most powerful, rudimentary, yet overlooked tools in music production. Repeat a phrase. Repeat it with a subtle variation. Repeat it on different instrument. These moves will create a call-and-response pull in your music.
5. On the flip-side, including **one-time events** is absolutely necessary for maintaining your listener’s interest and creating special, memorable moments within the arrangement. That could be a one-shot vocal chop, beastly drum fill, cascading dub delay… the options are endless. Find something that works for your track, and give it the special attention to detail it deserves.

## What is it?
A breakdown enhances the listener's experience of a song's core driving energy by **temporarily removing elements which push that energy**. A breakdown is often followed by a buildup in which the next wave of energy hits, which is more impactful than pushing the same amount of energy the whole time.

Say you have a crazy dubstep drop with multiple mid-range and low-range frequencies/one-shots along with drums and whatever else, but at some point this drop has to end to get to either the **outro** or the **second drop**, how do you achieve this?

By removing elements of the previous section, in this case the drop, it allows for you to swiftly transition into a breakdown to **relieve the tension** of the drop to lead into something else.

**Effects** can also be very helpful with this, including (but definitely not limited to) risers/uplifters, downlifters/crashes, etc. Other effects could also include applying them to the elements of your drop, such as putting a **LowPass Filter** on your basses.

## Example

This is where **reference tracks** come into play again. Notice at the **1:37** mark where the basses are **filtered out** when transitioning to the breakdown of the track, leading back to another buildup for the second drop of the song.

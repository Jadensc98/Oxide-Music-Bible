## What is it?
One key feature of electronic dance music is build-ups. They certainly exist in other genres of music (outside dance music), but in EDM, the use of build-ups is highly important to the track's structure. Dance music relies on three main elements: _tension_, _energy_, and _groove._ What do build-ups create? **Tension**.

Build-ups are absolutely essential to electronic dance music. Whether it’s a simplistic and subtle low-pass filter opening on a pad sound; or a fully-fledged, sonically splendid, snare and riser-filled build-up – the truth remains. **Build-ups are the number one way to create tension and excitement in music.**

# Why are they important?

## They make the drop seem bigger
Drop, chorus, climax – whatever you want to call it. A well-made drop coupled with a carefully crafted build-up makes for a dance-floor killer.

If your build-up is too weak, then it will draw away from the impact of your drop. Conversely, if your build-up is too strong and over-powering, it _too_ will draw away from the impact of your drop.

But why? Why does the listener perceive the drop as bigger and better when it’s preceded by a great build-up?

It’s all to do with tension and release. **Build-ups stretch the listener.** They stretch the listener to a point where there’s only one thing that can satisfy the emotional need cultivated by tension. A resolution, an _answer_ to the question.

Have you ever eaten a beautifully cooked meal after a long bout of hunger? That’s what it’s like. A 3-course meal tastes great almost all the time, but it tastes incredible when you’re starving. The drop is exactly the same, yet it’s perceived as better due to what takes place before it.

**Reason #1 why build-ups are important:** they make the drop _seem_ bigger and better.

---
## They Impact the listener emotionally
Yes, even the so-called “emotionless” genres of EDM do garner an emotional response from people. You don’t need to make music like Burial or MitiS to impact someone.

**Build-ups invoke excitement.** If there’s an area where you’re supposed to be depressed  and bored during a song, the build-up is not it (unless it’s really badly made of course).

Excitement and happiness go hand in hand. Ask any club owner if he’d prefer to have his club filled with unhappy people or happy people, I guarantee you it will be the latter. People who have an emotional response to your music are also more likely to remember it (marketing tip #341).

**Reason #2 why build-ups are important:** they impact the listener emotionally.

## They drive the song froward
Without tension and energy, your song won’t flow as well. In fact, it won’t flow at all. Micro-tension (crash cymbals, removing kicks at the end of 8 bars, etc.) drives the song along, keeping the listener interested. But a build-up? That’s the big mover.

Build-ups raise the energy level of a song to new heights and provide grounds for following parts to flow off them nicely.

**Reason #3 why build-ups are important:** they drive the song forward.

---
# How are they done?
There are a number of tools and tricks you can use when crafting a build-up. While the ones mentioned in this post are universally used, some of them are more suited to specific genres.

**Note:** by no means are these the _only_ tools that you should use, they’re simply the most common.

---
## Automation
Besides being pesky and annoying to use at times, **automation is the number one tool you have at your disposal when crafting build-ups.** Without automation, transitions will sound blocky and fragmented, tension will be static and unexciting, and your music will lack professionalism.

---
## Filters

```

The act of removing frequencies from a sound creates tension, regardless of what frequencies you’re removing (bringing down a low-pass filter does create tension too). Here are a few ways that filters can be automated during build-ups:

- **Cutoff:** automating filter cutoffs on synths is a great way to add tension.
- **High-passing your master channel:** contrary to popular belief, automation can be used on the master channel. Bringing up a high-pass removes the low-frequencies and causes your drop to have more impact.
- **Low-passing** certain sounds works great in build-ups.
- **Resonance** is a great way to add a harsher element to your filter automation. Push it hard or use it subtly to add tone.

---
## Reverb
If there’s one quick fix for everything in the world of music production, it’s reverb. Snare roll end too abruptly? Reverb. Pitch riser sound awkward? Drown it in reverb.

Do you want to know what’s even better than reverb itself? That’s right, _automating_ reverb. Here are a few uses for it in build-ups:

- **To “wash-out” sounds:** automating the dry/wet on sounds like risers, leads, and snare rolls can help create a more smooth transition between build-up and drop.
- **Increase decay:** automating the decay length of a reverb on particular sounds can be a great tool for adding tension in a build-up.
- **De-harsh:** reverb can also be used to _soak_ certain sounds and remove harsh characteristics. I often use a tonne of reverb on risers in order to remove harshness and place them in the background. This can be automated too (if some sounds come across as harsh at certain points).

---
## Pitch

```

There’s nothing that screams BUILD-UP more than a sound rising in pitch.

Automating pitch can be done in a subtle manner, or an obvious manner. Here are a few things you can apply pitch automation to:

- **Vocals –** loop a section of an acapella or grab a vocal sample and automate the pitch.
- **Risers –** self-explanatory? They rise… in pitch.
- **Snare rolls –** automating the pitch of a snare sample is a common technique used by many producers to add tension in a build-up.
- **Reverb tails –** bounce down a reverb tail from a sound to audio and then automate its pitch.

## Snare Rolls
Snare rolls can sound huge or small, they can be short or long, obvious or subtle, rhythmically complex or simple. As with anything, there’s a lot of choice.

The most simple way to create a snare roll is by doubling up the speed and shortening the length. For example, in the videos above I had a snare roll that started off with 4 bars of a snare hitting every beat, then it doubled to eighth notes, and so on. Here’s a visual representation of a compounding (almost) 8-bar snare roll.

Of course, your snare roll doesn’t have to compound like this, but it’s a good way to notify the listener that something’s about to happen.

**Quick tip:** you can use fills within rolls to add a little extra tension and interest to your compounding snare rolls. Here’s an example:

## Kick Rolls
The same principles apply to kick rolls as they do to snare rolls. However, you’ve got to be wary of phase issues that can arise in the low-end when kicks are slamming constantly (eighth or sixteenth notes consecutively). It pays to automate a high-pass filter on your kick as the rhythm speeds up (high-passing a kick naturally reduces its sustain so your build-up will sound less messy as a result).

---
## Delays
In the world of music production, there’s always more than one way to do something. And while the results may differ, it pays to experiment with as many ways as possible.

One thing I like to do instead of duplicating and shortening MIDI notes, is to use a delay. Watch the below video for further explanation.

## Risers
Risers are also essential as a background element for your buildups to create extra white noise and tension during the buildup. As you can hear in most buildups, there will be a subtle rise in pitch from a riser.

---
## Silence
One of the most important tools you have at your disposal as a producer is _silence._

Too often we focus on what we can add to the arrangement, what we can add to the build-up, but often, true impact comes from silence. It’s the reason why so many modern EDM tracks have half a bar or bar of silence before the drop.

I don’t mean complete and utter silence, but rather a break of sorts. Often producers will add a vocal sample in place of the silence for memorability (Animals by Martin Garrix as a cliché example). Besides, having a bar of absolutely zero volume often sounds awkward, which is why it helps to have a reverb tail of some sort from your riser, snare roll, or lead.

In short, don’t neglect the power of rests and silence.

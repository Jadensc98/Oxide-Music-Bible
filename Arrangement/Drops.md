## What is it?
A drop or beat drop in music, made popular by electronic dance music styles, is a point in a music track where a sudden change of rhythm or bass line occurs, which is preceded by a build-up section and break.

There are many different styles of drops per genre of music, and it is what usually defines what genre of music it is aside from the tempo/BPM of the song. Ex: "I want to make a future bass drop" so the rest of the elements of the song (normally) will be in a future bass style.

There are a bit too many styles of drops to cover in this bible, so it will be up to you to do a deeper dive into a genre that interests you and learn how the elements of those drops fit together.

## Basics of a drop
The very very barebones elements of a drop include things like your kick, bass, leads, and FX. There could be more or even less depending on the genre you choose.

## What is it?
In music, the introduction is **a passage or section which opens a movement or a separate piece, preceding the theme or lyrics**. In popular music, this is often known as the song intro or just the intro. The introduction establishes melodic, harmonic or rhythmic material related to the main body of a piece.

A song introduction, or an intro for short, is the first part of the song structure. It’s used to introduce and establish the song. The song intro gives an idea of the song’s style and genre while establishing the key and basic rhythm. Many song intros also include some kind of lyrics that can hint at the song’s themes and what kind of story it’s trying to tell.

In many cases, the song intro is just the same as the verse or chorus but without any [lyrics](https://yousician.com/blog/lyrics). However, the intro can also be completely separate from the rest of the song and not have any recurring elements that are repeated later on. Although songwriters need to create an intro that really catches the listener’s ear, the introduction should not reveal everything right away so that the listener wants to keep listening more of what’s to come.

There are different ways of writing an introductory passage to a song. The song can begin right away with the first verse or introduce the chorus. Many songs also begin with the central guitar riff or drum beat, for instance. It’s not uncommon to have an intro with only vocals. The song intro can be completely instrumental just as well.

## Finding your style
I believe that the biggest challenge in producing EDM music is finding your own flavor/style. This could be anywhere from creating entirely new genres, combining genres in a unique way, or even using an existing genre but pushing boundaries of the genre with new sounds created by you.

This will be your longest struggle and journey in EDM production. I cannot give too much advice here due to this being a more personal journey based on the individual, it will take creativity on your part to decide what you like the most.

## Example
Let's take Nitepunk for example. He curated his own style by taking an older genre, breakbeats, and turning it into something fresh and new, taking inspiration from more established artists like The Prodigy.

Another good example is Burial. Burial took the EDM scene by storm when he released the album "Untrue". He did not reinvent the wheel, he used the already existing Garage/Dubstep genre and made it his own with his own sounds and including samples of things he enjoys in his personal life to include in his music.

If you listen closely, in this track he's included the sound of falling bullet shells as a sample, the particular sound being from the Metal Gear Solid games which he enjoyed growing up.

## Collab bro?
Collaboration with other artists can be a great benchmark in your journey through music production. This can help you learn different techniques from your own. Collaborating can be different depending on the DAW that is used by both you and the other artist.

## Different DAWs
Depending on which DAW is being used, there are two main methods to collaborate. If your DAW is the *same* (with similar versions) all that needs to be done to trade progress back and forth is simply sending over the **project file** and the **samples** used within the project. 

If the DAWs are *different* however, you will need to put a little bit more work to send over your track to another artist to work on. In this case, it is best practice to export all of your **stems** (Samples, Instruments, everything) as **audio files** to send over to the artist for them to be able to use in their DAW. Popular DAWs like **FL Studio** and **Ableton** have ways that you can export all the elements of your song as audio files. It's best to *neatly organize* your track and label each of your tracks/channels before exporting them as stems. Ex: A channel where all the drums live.

Once the audio files are exported, now your track is a series of audio files stacked on top of each other.

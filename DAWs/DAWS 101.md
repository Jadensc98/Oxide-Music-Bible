## What is a DAW?
![[02QaOt9scNCqy2rcspJPLmq-21.webp]]

A **D**igital **A**udio **W**orkstation, commonly referred to as a **DAW**, is an audio production software or platform designed for the recording, editing, mixing, and mastering of digital audio files. In essence, it serves as a virtual studio where musicians, beat makers, audio engineers, and sound engineers can bring their musical ideas to life, from raw recordings to polished productions.

Today, there are many different types of DAWs like *Ableton, Logic Pro, Reason, Cubase, Studio One*, and others, all with a unique design, workflow, community, and set of tools.

See the article above for a more in depth few of the many capabilities of DAWs.

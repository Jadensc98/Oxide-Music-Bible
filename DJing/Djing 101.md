## What is it?
Djing is an art and entertainment form that consists of mixing music using DJ and sound equipment. DJs (disc jockeys) use a variety of techniques to create a unique and exciting listening experience for the audience.

Today, DJing is an ever-evolving industry, with DJs using a variety of tools and techniques to create unique and exciting music. Many DJs are world-renowned artists who fill stadiums and festivals, while others work in smaller clubs and events.

DJing has also gained popularity as a form of artistic expression and has been incorporated into other art forms, such as live music and performance. DJs also use advanced technology, such as state-of-the-art DJ software and controllers, to create innovative and amazing mixes.

## Equipment basics
![[que-se-necesita-para-ser-dj-640x426.jpg]]
- *Turntable*: is an analog electromechanical type [sound reproduction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction) system, successor to the gramophone, which uses the same type of technology, replacing the phonograph cylinder with a record. The turntable is also known as turntable, **turntable**, **turntable**, **phonochassis**, **turntable** or **pick-up***
- _CDJ / XDJ_: A CDJ is a specialized digital music player for DJs. Originally designed to play music from compact discs, many CDJs can play digital music files stored on USB flash drives or SD cards. Those devices that only play music stored on USB and cannot play CDs are called XDJs. In typical use, at least two CDJs are connected to a DJ mixer. CDJs have jog wheels and pitch faders that allow the digital music file to be manipulated in a similar way to a vinyl record on a DJ turntable. Many have additional features, such as loops and beat analysis, that are not present on turntables. In addition, some can function as DJ controllers to control the playback of digital files in DJ software running on a laptop instead of playing the files on the CDJ.
- _DJ controller_: A **DJ controller**, also called a **DJ mixer controller**, is a device used for disc jockeys (DJs) to **mix music** with a given software, using as control elements two consoles or decks, for the two parts of the mix; two jog wheels to create effects or modify the speed; two faders or volume levels; a crossfader or slider to mix the two decks; and buttons for equalization, for loading songs, effects, or speed variation (pitch). Other elements that are usually included are a headphone output to hear the song to be loaded while the previous one is playing, a USB output for a computer, and a line or microphone input. They usually provide easier control of the software than the computer keyboard and touchpad on a laptop, or the touchscreen on tablets and smartphones.DJ controllers do not mix audio signals like DJ mixers, but instead send signals to a computer to manage a song mixing program. Some DJ controllers can operate standalone, without a computer, or as a sound card, for recording or listening. The connection of the DJ controller to the computer is usually via USB, and they also use MIDI protocol. (See [[Equipment 101]])

## Quality
To be a good DJ, it is important to have a *good selection of music* of different genres and styles. This can include audio files in uncompressed format such as **WAV** or **AIFF** as well as compressed format such as **MP3**. The other current trend is to store music on *cloud hosting services* such as **Beatport Link**, **Dropbox**, **Soundcloud** or **Spotify** to name a few and sync the user account directly with the digital audio player via Wifi to access the music library.

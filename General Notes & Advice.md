## Advice from NEOLYTH
I've asked NEOLYTH for advice on Discord about where to go/what to do when you've reached a point in music production where your base skills can't be improved much further with advice. I've placed a few quotes from him below.

"but when u reach a certain point, u should be looking at getting releases"
"1. and then its just gonna come down to... whats a good tune? like making the vibiest shit u can then send it off"

I told him that I've found it a bit of a struggle getting releases as a small artist, since labels consider your following. 

"yea so ur gonna need a bit of networking and a little bit of luck labels are usually backlogged with releases and have already a whole bunch of sick artists on it u will need to get to know people who are even slightly involved or on the up, write tunes until ur skills continue to peak or u land on some very slick productions kinda put urself out there easier said than done a lot of soul searching, like 'how can i write better music' ur technique is already getting to the level so thats not gonna be ur issue."

"its not just making music and posting it to empty social medias and servers, its more about networking, as in interaction, proving urself, making some leaps and bounds getting to know people at all levels, not just the dons but the up and comers. working with people, these are the keys once u hit a certain point"

I then asked what he thinks about the importance of sounding unique.

"1. u should be trending towards sounding unique ofcourse. firstly ur already unique sonic fingerprint and all that as rabbit says, dont force it as in dont copy blindly then ull be a worse version of someone else but also, all the techniques, all the chords, reese, drum patterns etc has all been done before so to come out with something blindingly new is next to impossible and can take years, but as u know, some tunes even tho they are just a vocal, reese and some drums, some combinations are just that good. so its about landing the vibiest shit u can, not trying to be necessarily unique, a hits a hit. the right chords, with the right vocal and ur made"

After this, I said ""

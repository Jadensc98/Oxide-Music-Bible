## Advice from NEOLYTH
I've asked NEOLYTH for advice on Discord about where to go/what to do when you've reached a point in music production where your base skills can't be improved much further with advice. I've placed a few quotes from him below.

"but when u reach a certain point, u should be looking at getting releases"
"1. and then its just gonna come down to... whats a good tune? like making the vibiest shit u can then send it off"

Clipping is distortion. It happens when the amp or speakers become unable to keep up with the demands of the material being fed to it, and instead of the full waveforms of the sound you get truncated or 'clipped' representations of the sound. It also is an artifact of poor recording, where the mics or some other piece of gear in 
the chain likewise was not up to the task demanded of it.

## Soft Clipping & Hard Clipping

Clipping is good for achieving loud mixes and the distortion it implements can be pleasant.

Overdrive and distortion fx both hardware and software use clipping. Soft clipping is the same as hard clipping, but with added harmonics, which is akin to saturation.

It's counterintuitive, but soft clipping will be more audible than hard clipping, unless you're pushing the hard clipper to extremes. Because it's not that the soft clipper allows peaks above the threshold, but rather that it *starts* clipping *before* you cross the threshold.

(i.e. a soft knee)

So, with that in mind:

- Hard clipping when you want to use a little bit, and not hear the distortion.

- Soft clipping when you want to notice some crunch.

Think of hard clipping as the saturation equivalent of a limiter, and soft clipping the saturation equivalent of a compressor.

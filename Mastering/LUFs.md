LUFS stands for loudness units full scale. If you’ve heard of dBFS before, that “full scale” bit may sound familiar, and in fact, it’s integrally related here. Just as dBFS are decibels relative to full scale—where “full scale” is the highest level allowable in digital audio—LUFS are loudness units relative to full scale.

This rather inevitably leads to the question: “what is a loudness unit, or LU?” In the simplest terms, loudness units are the same as decibels, with one key difference: they attempt to factor in the ways in which our ear-brain system interprets [loudness based on the tonal balance](https://www.izotope.com/en/learn/what-is-fletcher-munson-curve-equal-loudness-curves.html "undefined") of a sound. The upshot is that if you take a sound or mix and just turn it up by 3 dB, its LUFS readings will also increase by 3 LU. However, if you apply EQ to a sound or mix without changing the level, the LUFS value may also change depending on how you EQ it.

## Why are LUFs important?

LUFS have become a de-facto standard for measuring audio loudness on many delivery platforms. In some cases—like audio for TV and film on Netflix, Amazon, etc. or Dolby Atmos mixes—the audio needs to be delivered in a way that meets certain specifications, whether they be integrated loudness, true peak, LRA, or some combination.

The other major use case is loudness normalization on music [streaming platforms](https://www.izotope.com/en/learn/mastering-for-streaming-platforms.html "undefined"). While you certainly don’t need to master your music to the normalization reference levels used by Spotify, Apple, Amazon, Tidal, and others, it is very helpful to understand what those levels are and how your music will sound when played back accordingly.

While it’s true that LUFS attempts to measure perceived loudness, and theoretically two songs that both measure as -14 LUFS integrated should sound identically loud, that’s often not quite the case in practice. They will likely be very close, but differences in arrangement, mixing, and mastering can result in small but noticeable differences in perceived loudness.

For that reason, it may be a good idea to audition your mix or master at some common normalization reference levels and compare it to your favorite reference tracks on a streaming platform that uses that reference level. Let’s look at some examples.

## What is Mastering?

Mastering is **the final stage of audio production**â€”the process of putting the finishing touches on a song by enhancing the overall sound, creating consistency across the album, and preparing it for distribution.

The purpose of mastering is **to balance the sonic elements of a stereo mix and optimize playback across all systems and media formats**. Traditionally, mastering is done using tools like equalization, compression, limiting and stereo enhancement.

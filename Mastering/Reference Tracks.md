A reference track is **a song from another artist to use as a benchmark for varying elements in your own productions**. For example, you might try to match your master's loudness to the loudness of a reference track, or you might try to match your arrangement to that of another song.

The way to use reference tracks is NOT to chase or try to match anything. You’re simply using it to see where where you are in terms of balance. In other words, while mixing in a vacuum, you may want your song to sound bright and you think it’s there…until you compare it to some references that are close to the amount of brightness you’re aiming for.

Or maybe you’re not sure where you want to go with it just yet. You can reference 4-5 tracks with completely different styles and balances and see where yours is sitting. Then decide which direction you want to go.

Matching another mix - mastered or not - is impossible. Different instruments and voices recorded in different spaces and ways all within different contexts. None of them will sound the same. But what you’re looking for is a way to determine up from down and left from right.

You should have a group of go to references that provide you a sonic roadmap.

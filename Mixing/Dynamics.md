## What is it?
Dynamics processing isn’t just about making things ‘louder’. In the context of mixing, dynamics processing can be used to control the dynamic range of an audio signal in order to achieve a variety of musical effects.

You can think of dynamics processing as having two major ‘families’: Downward Compression/Limiting and Expansion/Gating. Using both of these two major types of processing to adjust dynamic range is often essential to creating the illusion of a perfect performance—or at least the polished sound of one!

## What are dynamics for?
Using these processors is a way to control, reduce or expand the dynamic range or overall volume level of a track. In the case of compression and limiting, the goal is usually to “even out” the dynamic range of a track by attenuating loud transient peaks, such as a singer that suddenly belts out a high note in the middle of a gentle ballad, which can be a little jarring to the ear.

In the case of expansion and gating, the goal is to lessen or remove unwanted signal on a track. Removing the sound of high hat bleed in a snare drum recording would be one example. Reducing the volume of unwanted breaths in a vocal recording would be another.

## Principles of dynamics
The ability of a good mixing engineer to use dynamics processing effectively is truly a life-long learning process. So let’s start with the four basic parameters common to almost all dynamics tools, namely, threshold, ratio, attack and release.

--- 
## Threshold
The threshold is the level at which dynamics processing begins. For compressors and limiters, any signal rising above the threshold would be affected (see Fig. 1) For expanders and gates, any signal falling below the threshold would be affected (see Fig. 2)

## Ratio
The ratio determines the amount of dynamics processing that happens to the signal. For example, a 4:1 ratio (see Fig. 3) on a downward compressor means that for every 4dB the signal in question rises above the threshold only 1dB will be heard above the threshold, a reduction of 3dB. A limiter is a compressor with a ratio of 10:1 or greater—often as high as 20:1 or 30:1—and generally a fast attack time (see below). In the case of a gate, the threshold is ∞:1, meaning that any signal below the threshold will be muted.

## Attack
The Attack parameter defines how fast the dynamics processor works once the signal has passed the threshold, usually measured in milliseconds.

---
## Release
The Release parameter determines how fast or slow the dynamics processor stops processing or “lets go” once the signal has passed the threshold, also measured in milliseconds.

Compression essentially causes distortion in a signal, in that it changes the original sound of the signal through its processing. The compressor typically achieves this by emphasizing certain harmonics based on how the compressor is hitting the incoming signal. It’s our job to make that distortion feel transparent and to use our dynamics to create the best-sounding performance we can. One way to avoid adding more distortion is to be careful with our attack and release times—too fast an attack time can “choke” the performance and too fast a release time can cause the instrument to “pump”. 

Try setting these parameters and listen for yourself to hear the effect so you never do this again! In the picture below, the release time is too slow, and the compressor is squashing the signal before it has time to recover.

See, that was easy! Now that we know our parameters, how do we use them effectively? We don’t
necessarily want our track to be constantly compressed or squashed, so we should set our compressor to achieve the desired effect. But how do we know what the desired effect is?

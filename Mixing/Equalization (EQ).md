## WHAT IS EQ FOR?

We use equalization primarily to shape the tracks in our mix to fit well together. A mix engineer might for example reduce the low frequencies of a bass guitar to allow the kick drum to cut through the mix a little more clearly. But EQ can also enhance individual tracks, perhaps by boosting certain frequencies that make a snare sound punchy (150Hz–300Hz), or a voice sound airy (15kHz–18kHz).

## PRINCIPLES OF EQ

There are many different types of equalizers, and they all perform boosts and cuts in specific frequency ranges. The frequency range can be divided into several bands, such as a low band, a high band, and so on. This allows for unique adjustments to be made in certain areas. Equalizers usually consist of several bands: each band of an EQ is a single filter.

To understand the basics of how equalizers work we will first discuss the parameters in detail:
Parametric equalizers provide the greatest level of control for each band. The instantly recognizable ‘bell’ shape is the most commonly used of all EQ types, allowing independent control of the three most common variables: amplitude, center frequency and bandwidth.
The picture below shows the equalizer in Alloy 2, but the principles apply for most parametric EQs. One band has been selected and has been dragged down to cut the frequencies centered around 185Hz by -2.7dB

Each band of a parametric EQ typically has three controls:

**Frequency**: The center frequency of where the EQ band is placed within the frequency spectrum. In the picture below, the center frequency is 4900Hz, or 4.9kHz

**Gain**: How much we are boosting or cutting. In the picture below, the gain is being boosted by 2dB

**Q (Bandwidth)**: This represents the range of frequencies that are being adjusted by the Gain control. A frequency with a high Q will affect a narrow range and a frequency with a low Q will affect a wider range. In the picture below, the Q of 1.4 is fairly wide, and you can see which surrounding frequencies are also being affected.

While these are the controls for a parametric EQ’s bell filter, there are other types of EQ filters that are useful when mixing:

**Low/High-pass Filter**: This is a “one-sided” filter. By choosing a center frequency, we are attenuating (turning down) all frequencies below (high-pass filter) or above (low-pass filter) that frequency. You can determine how steeply the frequencies are attenuated by adjusting the slope setting, which is often configured in multiples of 6db per octave, such as 6db, 12db, 18db, 24db, 48db etc. In the picture below, we are using a high-pass filter with a Q/slope of 48dB to remove rumble.

**Low/High Shelf**: These EQ types are also “one-sided” and are called shelves because they resemble a shelf on a graph. This manifests sonically as well. A shelving EQ levels off for an overall cut or boost, whereas a bell shape is for more precise adjustments. The gain (boost/cut) affects all of the frequencies below our center frequency (low shelf) or above our center frequency (high shelf). In the picture below, a high shelf is adding 1.7dB of boost around a center frequency of 2378Hz. Note how it ‘shelves off’ above the center frequency, adding a high-end boost of 3.3dB.

## Personal Notes

- Try to sidechain kick through percussion as well.
- Subs and synths Sub from the Synth: If the synth generating the sawtooth bass has a strong low-end, you might not need a separate sub layer. Many modern synths allow you to blend a pure sine wave or a similar sub-bass waveform directly into the patch. This can be done by using a second oscillator set to a sine wave one or two octaves below the sawtooth, ensuring it provides a clean sub-bass component. Separate Sub Layer: In some cases, especially in more complex arrangements, a separate sub layer can offer more control. This means using a dedicated synth (like a sine wave generator) to create the sub-bass, ensuring it stays clean and focused. Processing the Mix Step-by-Step Guide: Sawtooth Bass: High-Pass Filtering: Apply a high-pass filter to the sawtooth bass to remove unnecessary low frequencies that would otherwise clash with the sub-bass. The cutoff frequency can be anywhere from 80 Hz to 150 Hz, depending on the sound and the mix. This allows the sawtooth's harmonic content to shine without muddying the low end. Sub-Bass Layer (if using a separate layer): Low-Pass Filtering: Apply a low-pass filter to the sub-bass layer to remove any high frequencies. This ensures that the sub-bass remains clean and focused. Typically, the cutoff frequency is around 80 Hz to 100 Hz. Mono Processing: Ensure the sub-bass is mono, as low frequencies are less directional and can cause phase issues if not centered.

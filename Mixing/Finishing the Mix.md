After the mix is largely finished, creatively speaking, the final steps are no less important. First, the mix needs to be delivered to the client for their approval. Then, any required revisions should be made and approved. And lastly, the mix should be delivered to the mastering engineer. Let’s look into specifics of these processes.

## Printing your Mix

Now that you feel that your mix is ready to present to the client, how are you going to send it to them?

There are several ways to do this:
1. **Bouncing / Exporting**: Your DAW should have a feature to internally record a stereo file of
your mix. It might be called ‘Bounce to disk’, ‘Export’, or some such term. We’ll discuss export
formats later in this chapter.

2. **Internal Foldback**: If you’re recording “out of the box”, either through an analog summing
device or a console, you can create a stereo track within your DAW and record your mix to
that track. This offers the added benefit of saving a copy of your mix within your session.
Once you’ve recorded your mix, you can then export the file into whatever format you would
like.

3. **External Print**: This is also useful when recording “out of the box.” With this method, you’re
recording to an external device (a 2-track tape, a CD burner, etc.)

## Your Master Bus

A lot of time and energy has been spent by mix engineers
arguing over whether or not to use certain processing on their
master bus.

There isn’t a right answer for this. If you plan on sending your mix
for mastering (which is highly recommend), it’s usually better to
not use any processing on your master bus. Even if you plan on
mastering your own mix, it will be worth your time to not process
your master bus, and, instead, master your mix at a later date.

Some professionals use a little compression and EQ on the master. So if you do decide to use process-ing—whether that be EQ, compression or so on—make sure to also print a mix without any processing. Also, don’t ever think “the mastering engineer will fix that.” You should deliver the best mix possible so the mastering engineers can do what they do best..

# THE FREQUENCY SPECTRUM
Before we begin EQ’ing, we should understand the frequencies we are about to adjust. Frequencies are measured in ‘Hertz’, or ‘Hz’. This can be easily understood as the number of cycles per second of any given wave. A 200Hz tone has 200 cycles per second, which ultimately provides us with a recognizable pitch.

Human hearing is commonly understood to perceive a range from as low as 20Hz to as high as 20kHz (20,000Hz). We refer to this range as the frequency spectrum.
Different instruments within a mix tend to be focused in different areas of the frequency spectrum.
How do we know where each instrument lies? We can certainly use our ears and our eyes, but let’s break this range down into five specific ranges using common terminology.

1. **Low End (125Hz and below)**: This is where all sub-bass and bass instruments reside. Be
careful, this frequency range is generally better “felt” than heard.
2. **Low-Mids (125Hz–500Hz)**: This range has the fundamental frequencies of a lot of lower
range instruments and can be a tricky one to master. Too much in this range could be de-
scribed as “muddy”, while too little will have your mix lacking power.
3. **Mid-Range (500Hz–2kHz)**: Almost every instrument sits somewhere in this range (vocals,
snare, guitars, piano, horns, etc.). This is where you will spend most of your time getting your
instruments to fit together.
4. **High-Mids (2kHz–8kHz)**: This range is where a lot of upper harmonics live (vocal breaths,
cymbals, etc.). This range is where you will find the “snap” in a kick drum and the “pluck” of
an acoustic guitar.
5. **High End (8kHz and above)**: This is where the “air” and “sizzle” resides. Too much energy
in this range can be fatiguing and will make the mix sound thin, while too little will make the
mix dull.

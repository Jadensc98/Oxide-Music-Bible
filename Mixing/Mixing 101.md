# WHAT IS MIXING?
Mixing is the craft of taking multiple audio tracks and combining them together onto a final master track—be it a 2-channel stereo master, or 6+ channels in the case of surround mixing. The way we combine tracks is equal parts art and science, and involves utilizing a variety of tools to bring out the most emotional impact from the song.

Mixing can be as simple as presenting great-sounding tracks in a more impactful way. Other times, mixing may require repairing tracks that sound sub-par. Each mix presents its own problems and challenges—it’s your job as the mixer to not only solve these problems, but to present the song the way it sounds in the client’s imagination.

## Kick drum
Start by EQ’ing your Kick. There are usually a couple of trouble spots: Between 200Hz–500Hz (which can sound “tubby”), 600Hz–1 kHz (“boxy”) and 2kHz–4kHz (“pointy” or “clicky”). There isn’t a hard and fast rule for this (or any of these for that matter), but these are frequencies worth examining first to see if you hear any issues.

Although you do want a solid low end, even a kick drum can have too much of a good thing, so to speak. Using a high-pass filter to cut some low end rumble out of the kick drum, particularly below 30Hz, can help clean up the overall bass sound of your mix.

Next, you might want to compress your kick. A gentle ratio can help tame the initial click and allow you to increase the overall volume, resulting in a louder, smoother kick drum. Since this is reducing the dynamic range, the net result is that quieter kick hits (particularly in a passage where the drummer is using the kick heavily) will sound ‘louder’, and the kick will become more even.

> **TIP**: Try using Alloy 2’s unique Transient Shaper to adjust the volume level of the ‘Attack’ (initial hit) and ‘Sustain’ (fade-away) of the Kick Drum. For a ‘boomier’ kick, increase the amount of sustain (see Fig. 6). The body and ring of the kick will become fuller and more apparent. For a tighter kick, reduce the sustain (see Fig. 7), and add some attack.

## Snares and Toms

Suggested EQ settings can vary wildly depending on the tone of the snare and toms. For example, some snares have a fantastic ‘round’ tone around 200–250Hz, while other snare drums can sound very muddy in this range.

> **TIP**: Routing your drum tracks to a stereo drum bus that sits ahead of the master channel can help here, as you can use Alloy 2’s EQ on the drum bus to locate and hear problems before fixing these problems on the individual drum tracks.

A lot is going to be determined by listening to your drum kit as a whole and hearing what needs to be emphasized or deemphasized.

Oftentimes, the ‘snap’ of the snare that sounds really great and crisp competes with the sibilance of the lead vocal around 3–5kHz, which can cause problems. This is another good reason to leave your vocal track audible while working on your drums. Listening to the overtones of your snare as you EQ will help you determine what harmonics might be masking your lead vocal, and what EQ points will help emphasize the snare while staying out the vocal’s way.

As for compression, a lot of the same rules apply to the snare as they do to the way you might treat ambient drum microphones (read on). As with the kick, you can tame the initial transient with some gentle compression to achieve a smoother sound.

> **TIP**: Be careful not to over-compress the snare. A hyper-compressed snare can be much more lifeless and squashed sounding than a kick drum can.

## Percussion

This can be anything from shakers and tambourine, to congas and timpani, to electronic percussion and anything in between.

As these instruments vary in tone, and often take up smaller areas of the frequency spectrum, EQ
adjustments are often drastic, in order to make the percussion fit into or cut through a mix.

Compressing percussion requires much higher ratios, as well as quicker attack and release times. Ratios between 5:1–8:1, though heavy, are recommended. When a percussion sound is too short, smoothing out the transient peaks allow us to hear the decay and character of the sound a little more clearly. You might use a release time as low as 20ms.

Percussion can be used to add rhythmic excitement, but bear in mind that too much can distract the listener from the fundamental core of your mix. Use percussion sparingly. Consider turning the level way down during the verse, while always making sure to balance the panning so that you don’t have all of your percussion centered around just the left, or just the right channels.

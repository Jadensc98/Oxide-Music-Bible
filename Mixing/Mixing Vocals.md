## Lead Vocal

Now we get to the star! Unless you’re mixing the next great instrumental jazz record, the lead vocal is usually the single most important track in your entire mix. This is what everybody will focus on when they hear the song. A well-tracked and well-performed vocal may need little processing. On the other hand, a vocal that’s poorly performed or recorded may require the audio equivalent of serious open-heart surgery.

Here’s an extensive list of processors commonly used in complex vocal chains:

• **High-pass Filter**: To remove any unwanted low end signal.
• **De-Esser**: To remove any sibilance that could get emphasized later through EQ.
• **“Surgical” EQ**: This is an EQ that’s useful in removing unwanted frequencies. For example, between400–800Hz there may be a frequency that could make the singer sound like they are singing into a cheap microphone, and between 2–4kHz there is usually a frequency that emphasizes a nasal sound. These are some to look out for
• **Limiter**: This is usually set to hit the highest peaks of a vocal performance at 2– 3db of gain
reduction.
• **Shaping EQ**: Use this EQ to emphasize and compliment the best qualities of the singers voice. If
needed, use a shelving EQ on the top end to add “air” to the voice.
• **Compression**: This is where you can shape the overall dynamic range of the voice. This can go
from subtle to extreme depending on the genre of music or the sections within a song. For
compression, a medium attack and fast release would be a good starting point. You’ll have to
adjust your threshold for an uneven performance and deal with other issues with automation.
• **Saturation**: Top your vocal processing with a light form of tape saturation to add a nice character to the voice.
• **Reverb/Delay**: Whether it be a nice plate reverb, some dirty analog-style delay, or some clean
digital echoes, reverb and delay are the key to making a vocal really stand out and shine.

> **TIP**: When adding reverb to a vocal, many good reverbs offer the ability to filter the ‘wet’ or reverberant signal. Try rolling of the high end of the wet signal until the ‘shiny’ reflections sit just underneath the vocal sibilance. Otherwise, adding a lot of reverb in the high end can create a new space that, in fact, competes with the dry vocal.

> **TIP**: As a bonus, sometimes a lead vocal benefits from a slight (8% wet or less) chorus effect. A good voice is never boring, but utilizing a chorus effect mixed in at a low level can add just enough movement around center to make the lead vocal even more interesting.

## Background Vocals

These can also vary wildly, but there are usually two types of background vocals: Vocals that harmonize and share lyrical content with the lead vocal line, and vocals that act as pads (oohs and ahhs for example). For the harmony lines, you should discuss with the client how loud they think the harmonies should be. Are they acting almost as a dual lead vocal, or should they be lower in the mix as a support for the lead?

For pad vocals, try compressing them slightly more, using a more extreme high-pass filter, and drenching them in reverb for added dramatic effect. These types of vocals can vary in how widely they are panned. Sometimes if they are double tracked, they can be panned hard left and right. Although, in recent years, these types of vocals have had a much tighter panning in mixes which leaves more room for guitars and keyboard pads to be panned wider.

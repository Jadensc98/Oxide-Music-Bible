#mixing 
Now that you’ve created the basic framework and shape of your mix, it’s time to create some motion within the mix to compliment the arrangement.

When listening to a song, you’ll notice changes in energy from section to section. For example, have you ever noticed how the energy changes when a song transitions from a verse to a chorus?
Part of what you’re noticing (especially in a good mix) is how the mix compliments that transition. The most important thing is to create a forward motion that best compliments and presents the song. One of the most important elements that we have available to us in music is that, unlike a painting or a sculpture, a song develops over time. It isn’t static, it is dynamic, and our mix should reflect this. There are a few ways to do this:

• First, have fewer tracks in verses than there are in choruses and try to introduce something new in
each section as the song progresses. It isn’t unusual for an artist to present a mix engineer with a
full complement of tracks and instrumentation, and for the mix engineer to make some decisions
about where to cut, mute or otherwise change parts and arrangements.

• Pan tracks and verses narrowly and chorus tracks wider. Perhaps a verse will have a mono acoustic guitar panned halfway to one side, and a chorus will have double tracked guitars panned hard left and right.

• Have tracks and verses carry less low- and high-end information and choruses be full range—this
will create harmonic excitement in your mix.

• Use either mono effects or effects with a shorter decay time in verses and stereo effects with
longer decay time in choruses. This will help the depth of your mix move as the song progresses.

• Use distortion sparingly (or not at all) in verses and enter it in gradually for each chorus. This aids
in creating even more harmonic excitement than you can with EQ alone. Distortion doesn’t need
to be extreme—just a little can change the sound immensely. You don’t want to overwhelm it, just
give it a little kick.

• With drums, automate your ambient microphones to change between verses and choruses. There
are two schools of thought with this: Bringing up your overhead and room mics in choruses will
widen the stereo image of your drums and make the overall kit sound larger, while bringing
those ambient mics down in choruses will leave a lot more room for guitars and other harmonic
instruments that will be coming in. Try experimenting with both approaches to see what style best
meets the needs of your mix.

The objective to all of these points and tips is to change the three-dimensional image of our mix along with the song. We’re trying to make the song “breathe” by adding width, depth and harmonic excitement as the song itself gets more exciting, and having those elements contract as the song becomes sparser and changes lyrically and dynamically.

Another way to think of it is that the song is telling a story. Every story has its ups, its downs and its
transitional periods, and the mixer uses tools to frame that story.

## Automation

We use automation to achieve the same effect as all of the elements above. We want to both “even out” uneven performances dynamically, and emphasize particular points of excitement within a mix. Many mixes utilize automation. For instance, automation on a lead vocal can keep the vocal on top of the mix and emphasize particular words and phrases within the song to achieve the best emotional impact.

Another good use of automation is to emphasize a ‘build’ on a particular instrument to make the section feel more dramatic. Automation, as stated before, is also helpful for changing the level of tracks from section to section within a song (as we stated with ambient drum mics). This is the type of device that you can use as sparingly or as liberally as you wish. There are no rules for automation—some mixers despise it and others adore it. So use it to your heart’s content, provided it makes your mix better.

Believe it or not, there will be a point where you feel your mix is ready or close to ready! This could also be the point where you’ve lost all perspective and need another set of ears to listen to it. This will be the time you’re ready to send your mix to the client. However, there are a few practical tips you should know before that all-important email goes out:

• Be sure to take frequent breaks, since ears get tired from overuse. A few general rules of thumb
are to take a 10-minute break every hour (therapists do it, so why shouldn’t we?). Another option
is what is known as 90/20 rule: A 20 minute break every 90 minutes. Sometimes it’s important to
spend as much time not listening to the mix as it listening, that way your ears will be refreshed
when you start working again

• A mix is a series of logic riddles, similar to building a house of cards. In many cases, one action will affect something else in your mix. Listen to subtle changes carefully to understand the effect they have on other tracks.

• Remember, the solo button is your enemy! When listening to a track soloed, you have no point of
reference for how it sits in the mix. It’s fine to solo an instrument to find out if there’s a trouble spot in the performance or how you’ve processed it, but you should then immediately take it out of solo and listen to it in the context of the full mix. A better option is to bring the fader for that particular track up in your mix to hear what the issues are. It doesn’t give a perfect sense of context, but it’s a lot better than just hearing it by itself.

• Listen to your mix on different speakers and in different environments, particularly environments
where you normally listen to music. If you have any questions about how a certain instrument may
be sitting in your mix, you’ll have better information if you know you’re speakers aren’t tricking
you. Also, your client is likely to perform the ‘car test’, or ‘ear-bud test’, listening to it in as many
environments that are as far removed from a treated, acoustically good mix room as possible!

• Have a list of songs to reference that you are familiar with. Create a playlist of numerous songs that you know intimately. Listen to how the vocals sit in the mix, how the reverbs and delays sound in context to the instruments, where the drums sit in relation to the bass and guitars, how tight or
how loose the low end is, and so on. Comparing your mix to familiar material can gives you a point
of reference for everything that you’re doing. Having the client suggest references mixes that they
admire can help in this regard.

• At some point, or multiple points during your mix, turn off the computer screen and just listen to
the mix. You’ll be surprised at what you can hear when you remove the visual component from
your work.

• If at all possible, when you finish your mix, put it away for the night and listen to it when you first
get to the studio the next day. This will give you the freshest perspective you can possibly have
and will give you a psychological and physical rest before sending the mix off to the client

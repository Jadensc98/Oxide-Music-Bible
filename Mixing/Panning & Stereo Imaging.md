## What is it?
If we think of Level and EQ as the ‘height’ or ‘vertical’ part of our mix equation, panning is the ‘width’ or ‘horizontal’ part of our mix equation. Music is typically mixed and listened to in stereo. Panning a single audio element within a mix is the process of weighting the element more heavily in favor of either the left or right speaker.

## What is panning for?
Panning in large part determines how wide our mix ends up sounding to the listener. It can be used to create space in a mix, enhance existing space, and create a more immersive musical experience for the audience.

## Principles of panning
How do we know what to pan, and where? A general rule in much of today’s popular music is that the backbeat and lead vocal are the focal points of the mix. Because of this, the kick, snare and lead vocal are usually panned center, often referred to as ‘C’ or ‘0’ by most DAWs. The other elements of the mix are what the mix engineer typically uses to create a stereo image of your song. Our ears tend to focus on the signals in a mix that are panned center or panned extreme left or right.

> **TIP**: When recording acoustic guitars, ‘double-tracking’ (recording the same part twice), and panning one recording extreme left, and the other extreme right can create a much fuller sounding mix without overloading the instrumentation of the arrangement.

This doesn’t mean that the space in between Center (Left and Right) is to be ignored. Understanding these common approaches will help you determine what you want the listener to hear and experience by where you pan that particular instrument.

> **TIP**: Panning a snare dead center can immediately make it sound punchier, panning it slightly to one side might cause the listener to focus slightly more on the lead vocal or kick drum, and so on.

## Mid / Side Processing
Any discussion of panning and stereo imaging techniques in general would be incomplete without
mentioning mid / side processing, so let’s take a look at that before we dive into the art of panning.

The concept of Mid/Side Processing comes from

a mic technique patented by Alan Bluemlein in 1934. The original idea was to recreate how a pair
of human ears hears a stereo image. It came to be used effectively as a recording technique to enhance ‘space’ before stereo playback existed. The basic setup is: One cardioid microphone (mid) and one bidirectional (figure of eight) microphone (sides).

Either during or after recording, the process includes
copying the side mic signal and reversing the phase.
This would leave you with two audio signals, one
called ‘mid’, and the other, ‘side’. In the picture below,
we have a ‘stereo’ audio file. The left channel is the
‘mid’ and the right channel is the ‘side’.

Listen to the mid microphone signal—you’ll hear a mono image. When you add the side signal, the stereo image changes. The louder the side channel is, the wider the audio is perceived. This is due to the phase correlation between the two mics. It’s an interesting sounding recording technique, particularly for capturing drum sounds in a room. But how is this used in the mixing process?

Simply put, Mid/Side processing in the mixing or mastering stages separates an ordinary stereo
recording into its separate areas of your soundstage, independently. Mid/Side Processing lets you work independently with the center of the stereo image or the sides. The mid channel, (the sum of Left and Right, or everything common to both the left and right speakers) can be isolated from the side channel, (which is everything different between the left and right speakers) for separate processing.

For instance, if you have a stereo drum bus, applying some high-end boost to the side channel makes the ‘wider’ elements sound brighter. Also, adding some mid-range boost can add punch to a snare drum without muddying up your reverb, which is often more noticeable in the side channel.

To process audio in mid/side, you must have either recorded it in mid/side to begin with, or encoded the signal for processing, then decoded the signal after processing back into the conventional L+R format for playback. If you don’t have a recorded mid/side instrument in your mix, there are a few plug-ins that do mid/side encoding (including iZotope Ozone, seen below EQ’ing in mid/side mode).

#mixing 
Think of a mix as a sonic three-dimensional image. There are four essential elements that we use to control
that image:
1. Level (Height)
2. EQ (Height)
3. Panning (Width)
4. Time-Based Effects (Depth)

## LEVEL

Level seems pretty simple—when we want to hear something louder, we turn up a fader. And the louder components of the mix grab the listener’s attention more than the quieter components.

## EQ
[[Equalization (EQ)]]
EQ is really just a more detailed level control that lets us boost and cut levels at specific frequencies. EQ is the easiest way to shape the tracks in your mix so they fit together—and provides a powerful way to add personality and character to the individual tracks.

## PANNING
[[Panning & Stereo Imaging]]
If you were to think of level and EQ as the vertical (up/down) elements, panning would be the horizontal (left/right) element. Panning can be very helpful on instruments that sit in the same frequency range. By panning one to the left and the other to the right, you can separate the two instruments and reduce the chance of one instrument masking the other, and making it harder to hear.

## TIME BASED EFFECTS

Time-based effects form the element of depth (front to back). Time-based effects such as reverb and delay can make an instrument seem further away, or sometimes bigger than a dry instrument.
The elements discussed above allow us to create a three-dimensional image, but there’s also a fourth dimension available to us—time. Time is the key way that music differs from static art forms like paintings and sculptures. 

You can stare at the Mona Lisa all day long and she’ll never change—she’s had that wry smile on her face hundreds of years. Conversely, a song can change within 30 seconds of listening to it and can go through multiple changes throughout the length of the song.

So utilizing the four elements we have control over and changing them throughout a song’s structure can result in a vibrant and dynamic mix. Mixing involves a fair amount of slight of hand you’re deciding what instruments the listener is focusing on and you can change their focus within the mix at any point. A good example of this is going from a vocal melody to another instrument soloing. You’ve now seamlessly taken the attention of the listener from the vocal to the solo
